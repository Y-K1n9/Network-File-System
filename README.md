# Docs++ — Distributed Network File System

A distributed file system built with C, POSIX sockets, and pthreads.  
Implements a **Naming Server (NM) + Storage Server (SS) + Client** architecture.

> **This branch completes the robust NFS Concurrency requirements:** Sentence Level Locking, Concurrent Reads/Writes, and Full Word-Level WRITE implementations, alongside UNDO and EXEC.

## Feature READ & STREAM (Direct Data Streaming)

- **Lookup & Status Authorization**: The Naming Server enforces user access control permissions and verifies that the Storage Server is actively online before returning its address to the client.
- **Direct Data Streaming**: The NM is kept out of the data path. The client establishes a direct TCP connection with the Storage Server. The SS streams the file in chunks using `FileChunkPacket` and terminates with a STOP packet (`chunk_size == 0`).
- **Word-by-word Simulation (`STREAM`)**: Displays contents word-by-word with a delay of 0.1 seconds between each word. Reports a clean error if the Storage Server goes down mid-stream.

### Expected Output (READ)
```
alice@docs++ > READ report.txt
  Looking up 'report.txt'...

─── report.txt ───────────────────────────────────
Hello from Docs++ NFS. This is a direct data stream test.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Expected Output (Permission Denied)
```
bob@docs++ > READ report.txt
  Looking up 'report.txt'...
✗ ERROR: Permission denied for file 'report.txt'.
```

### Expected Output (SS Offline)
```
alice@docs++ > READ report.txt
  Looking up 'report.txt'...
✗ ERROR: Storage Server hosting 'report.txt' is offline.
```

### Expected Output (STREAM)
```
alice@docs++ > STREAM report.txt
  Looking up 'report.txt'...

─── STREAM: report.txt ─────────────────────────────
Hello from Docs++ NFS. This is a direct data stream test.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## Feature DELETE (System-Wide & Replication Eviction)

- **System-Wide Eviction**: Owners can delete their files. Deleting a file wipes the physical file from the active Storage Server and immediately evicts the entry from the Naming Server's lookup mapping so future client lookups instantly fail.
- **Replication Eviction**: The delete command automatically cascades to clear all replica storage server copies of the file.

### Expected Output (DELETE Success)
```
alice@docs++ > DELETE report.txt
  Deleting file 'report.txt'...
✓ File 'report.txt' deleted successfully.
```

### Expected Output (Non-owner Attempt)
```
bob@docs++ > DELETE report.txt
  Deleting file 'report.txt'...
✗ ERROR: Permission denied. Only the owner 'alice' can delete this file.
```

---

## Feature WRITE & ETIRW (Word-Level Editing)

- **Interactive Editing Session**: Users can update the content of a file at the word level. Initiating a write opens a direct connection to the hosting Storage Server.
- **In-Memory Word/Sentence Tokenization**: The Storage Server splits the file content into dynamic sentences and words using `.`, `!`, and `?` as sentence delimiters.
- **Sentence-Level Locking**: Concurrent writers can edit the exact same file simultaneously! The server uses an isolated `pthread_mutex_t` for every sentence node in memory, completely eliminating index-shifting data corruption.
- **Commit on ETIRW & Lock Release**: Typing `ETIRW` finishes the write session, seamlessly splices the new memory nodes, writes the file to disk, calculates statistics for the Naming Server, and atomically destroys the lock so other users can edit.

### Expected Output

```
alice@docs++ > WRITE report.txt 0
  Looking up 'report.txt'...
Client: 1 Hello from Docs++ NFS.
Client: ETIRW
✓ Write Successful!
```

---

## Feature 3 — LIST (Show Connected Users)

Displays all registered clients currently connected to the Naming Server.

### Expected Output
```
alice@docs++ > LIST

  Connected Users:
  Username              IP Address        Status  
  ───────────────────   ───────────────   ────────
  alice                 127.0.0.1         online  
  bob                   127.0.0.1         online  

  2 user(s) total.
```

---

## Feature 5 — Comprehensive Error Codes

Consolidates all error codes into a single, standardized set returned consistently across the system:

| Code Value | Macro Symbol | Scenario |
|:---:|---|---|
| `0` | `ERR_OK` | Success |
| `-1` | `ERR_NO_PERMISSION` | Unauthorized access |
| `-2` | `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | File not found |
| `-3` | `ERR_FILE_EXISTS` | File already exists |
| `-4` | `ERR_FILE_UNAVAILABLE` | Storage server is offline |
| `-5` | `ERR_NO_SS_AVAILABLE` | No Storage Server online |
| `-6` | `ERR_INTERNAL` | System / socket / file I/O failure |
| `-7` | `ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE` | Index out of range |
| `-8` | `ERR_MAX_CLIENTS` | Max registered client limit reached |
| `-9` | `ERR_MAX_FILES` | Naming Server registry full |
| `-10` | `ERR_FILE_LOCKED` | Resource contention / locking (future) |
| `-11` | `ERR_NETWORK` | Network failure |

---

## Feature — Access Control (ADDACCESS & REMACCESS)

- **Ownership-based Authorization**: The creator of a file automatically becomes its owner (with RW access). Only the owner can modify access permissions for other users.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Permissions are instantly synchronized with the Naming Server and take effect immediately for connected clients.

### Expected Output (Granting Access)
```
alice@docs++ > ADDACCESS -R report.txt bob
✓ Access granted successfully!
```

### Expected Output (Verifying Access)
```
bob@docs++ > INFO report.txt

─── report.txt ───────────────────────────────────
  Owner:          alice
  Size:           12 bytes
  Words:          2
  Characters:     11
  Created:        2026-07-05 22:52
  Last Modified:  2026-07-05 22:53
  Last Accessed:  2026-07-05 22:53
  Your Access:    R
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Expected Output (Revoking Access)
```
alice@docs++ > REMACCESS report.txt bob
✓ Access removed successfully!
```

## Wire Protocol

All communication is **binary fixed-size structs** over TCP:

1. Sender writes `int32_t command_type` (the first field of every packet)
2. NM reads `command_type` first, then reads the rest of the struct

Command IDs defined in `common/protocols.h`.

## Change History (Feature Log)

### 2026-07-03
- **Feature 3 (LIST Connected Users)**: Implemented `LIST` command in client REPL, querying Naming Server for the active registry of client names, IP addresses, and online statuses.
- **Feature 5 (Universal Error Codes)**: Consolidated and standardized system-wide error definitions in `protocols.h`, mapping internal failure states to universal return codes.
- **Code Refactor & Bug Fixes**: Removed unused variables (e.g. `storage_dir` context propagation to threads), cleaned block comments, and fixed a bug where `handle_ss_delete` in storage server failed to send an ACK packet back to the naming server.

### 2026-07-05
- **Access Control (`ADDACCESS`, `REMACCESS`)**: Added the ability for file owners to dynamically grant Read (`-R`), Read/Write (`-W`), or completely revoke access for other users. Integrated Access Control Lists (ACL) into the Naming Server registry.
- **INFO Command Implementation**: Finished the missing implementation of `INFO` in the client CLI to display rich file metadata, including timestamps, sizes, and the current user's access level.

### 2026-07-07
- **Distributed Concurrency & Sentence Locking**: Completely overhauled the Storage Server's file handling architecture. Migrated from raw buffer manipulation to a dynamic, in-memory `LiveFile` Linked List containing `SentenceNode` objects.
- **Lock Management**: Implemented granular `pthread_mutex_t` locks at the sentence level, allowing multiple clients to edit different sentences within the same file simultaneously without the "Index Shifting" problem.
- **Full WRITE/ETIRW Completion**: Clients now successfully pass `sentence_number` and `word_index` across the network, which the backend safely splices into memory nodes and commits to disk atomically on `ETIRW`, gracefully releasing locks.
- **UNDO Integration**: Bridged the newly merged remote `UNDO` feature with the local `LiveFile` caching system to ensure file restorations properly clear memory and re-sync across concurrent sessions.
```
